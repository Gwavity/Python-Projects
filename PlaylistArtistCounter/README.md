You should copy the playlist(by copying all songs in the playlist and clicking add to playlist) that you would like to check becuase this deletes the one you were checking originally.

**This will take every artist in your playlist and count how many songs you have from each artists.(Artist Features don't get added)**

**CUSTOM SONGS CAUSE THIS TO BREAK AND RECOUNT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, SO IF YOU HAVE CUSTOM SONGS IN THE PLAYLIST MAKE SURE TO DELETE THEM**
